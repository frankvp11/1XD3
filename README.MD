**Why Design?**




Interface  - what we are doing when we are designing an application

- "between two faces" = communication
- NOT the skin of the application


The Design of Everyday things - by Don Norman

- Sets a new standard for designing things, not only for software.

However, everything that we do need to know can be found in Anand's textbook.

Design is something that can be learned 
- Not taught in Science and Engineering


**Design Science/Thinking**
- Science side of things is how to do reserach on human artifacts.
- Thinking side of thing sis how to implement this science.

Science is about understanding the world
- failures cause us to refine our theory
  
Design thinking is about understnading the user
- failures help us discover real user needs.

We should be happy when we fail, since we can learn more about our user when the prototype fails.


Example: Documentation

Anand wrote lots of documentation
- API's
- Tutorials


However this was too boring

Eventually they created the shape creator. This was more interactive, and more used than the documentation itself.

Let user's curiousity guide them. People are going to click things that seem clickable.


Look back to the Double Diamond and the difference between what you are designing

What is empathy? 
- Being able to understand things from other people's point of view

Optimism
- Necessary for wanting to try ideas.

Iteration
- Continuously improve on your code / algorithms

Learning from Failure
- instead of getting sad at a 60, be happy you learn

Ambiguity 
- Sometimes the specifications won't be specific - get used to this, and embrace it

Creative Confidence
- you must have confidence to tell others your ideas. Don't be afraid of people laughing at your ideas.




**Prototyping**

Make your first prototypes simple (e.g. paper)

- Collect user feedback
  - Until you know the next step
  - Usually 2-5 users
- Repeat



What is a Prototype?


- An App
  - Takes a long time develop, save for later
- A cardboard mock-up
  - Draw the UI elements you need
  - Move them around based on user "taps"


Reflection is something that is very important for Design Thinking.

Be sure to reflecto n the failures and successes of your apps.
- More empathy
- Generate more ideas
- Start with simpler prototypes
- Type faster?
